## List of Techniques:
* [Basic/Intermediate/Advanced (Mild/Medium/Spicy)](Basic/Intermediate/Advanced-(Mild/Medium/Spicy))
* Live coding/code-alongs
* Diagramming
* Heterogeneous groupings for groupwork
* Starter code
* Commenting code
* Student demos
* Pseudocode
* Pre-built tests/pre-built results
* Anchor charts/cheat sheets
* Additional resources



### Technique: Basic/Intermediate/Advanced (Mild/Medium/Spicy)

#### Well-suited to...
* Variety of learners ( & experience level)
* Project-based work
* Group work pacing <- can focus on mild first, then move to medium/spicy
* Grading rubric  (can also do as Must Haves/Make It Awesomes)
  * levels of mastery based on how much is completed
  * how developed or advanced the students' work is upon completion


#### Example
* Critical Thinking project
  * process of solving problems?
  * what steps to take and what order?
* Data sort (linear and binary sort) projects
* Use in nearly any coding project!

### Technique: Live coding/Code-alongs

#### Well-suited to...
* Visual learners
* Teach students to check their code for errors/mistakes
* Demonstates to students that teachers, too can make mistakes!
* Illustrating thinking processes from different coders' perspectives
* Shows the students what the computer is actually doing.
* Trains students to look out for GOTCHAS- common mistakes that people make while developing code
* Introducing new syntax

#### Example
* Trace Diagrams.
* name of a not-necessarily coding activity
* code snippet to illustrate
* etc

### Technique: Diagramming

#### Well-suited to...
* Illustrating control flow visually
* thing
* other thing

#### Example
* name of a coding activity (like BinarySearch, For loops, etc)
* name of a not-necessarily coding activity
* code snippet to illustrate
* etc
