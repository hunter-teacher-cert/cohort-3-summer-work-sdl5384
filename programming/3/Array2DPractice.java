   INSTRUCTIONS:
   Place this file in a folder named programming/3/.
   This file contains the following completed method. Use it as a model
   to help you with the other methods:
   - buildBoard
   This file also contains stubs (empty methods) for the following
   methods (split into 3 levels):
   Basic level (complete all):
   - printBoard *
   - copyBoard *
   Intermediate level (complete Basic methods plus this method):
   - explodeSquare *
   Advanced level (complete Basic + Intermediate + these two methods):
   - explodeAllChar *
   - downString
   The routines with the * will be particularly helpful for the
   Conway's Game of Life project that you'll work on after this one.
